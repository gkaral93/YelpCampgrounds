# About The Project
YelpCampgrounds is a yelp style, campground themed website. It allows for users to browse and search campgrounds that the community adds. The campgrounds are rated using a "like" system, and the users are able to talk about the campgrounds through a campground comment system. Once you login or signup you can begin to create your own campgrounds that includes a title, image, address and short description.
